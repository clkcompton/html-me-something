        <h3>(well sort of)</h3>
          <p>In may of 2014, I was in desparate need of some cashflow to pay for college, so I got into some unusual hobbies to pay the bills. My job quickly became a passion, and six and half years later I'm still at it. Let's go through each of my quirky circus hobbies, shall we..</p>

            <p>Demanding kids and cranky parents might be a deterent for most, but I say "Bring it on!" Turning someone's face into a work of art is an absolute joy for me, and it just so happens people are willing to pay for it too! Don't worry, this skill is on hold at the moment - it is definitly not Covid friendly! </p>

            <p>Honestly, this hobby was not in the plans, but has totally paid off. I stroll around at an event and show off my moves, usually as a hooping witch or a hooping sugarplum fairy.</p>

            <p>Ocasionally I'll pick up a random skill for a specific event or show. These odds and ends include basic magic(I'm the worst at it), bullwhip, character impersonations, henna, etc.</p>
